## Pacific Salmon Foundation Marine Data Centre

The [Pacific Salmon Foundation](https://psf.ca)'s **Marine Data Centre** helps support the protection and restoration of Pacific salmon by providing open, accessible, and well-organized data and tools for researchers, communities, and decision-makers.

We work with partners across British Columbia to compile and organize data related to salmon habitats, populations, and threats. Our goal is to make salmon-related information transparent, usable, and available in formats that support analysis, mapping, and storytelling.

As part of this effort, we are currently organizing and documenting key datasets, improving metadata, and developing internal systems that will enable more streamlined data sharing.

To explore the Data Centre, visit [our website](https://marinedata.psf.ca), or browse tools like the [Marine Data Portal](https://soggy2.zoology.ubc.ca/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home), the [Marine Ecosystem Map](https://marinedata.psf.ca/sogmrg/), or the [Contaminants Atlas](https://marinedata.psf.ca/atlases/contaminants-atlas/).
